# ðŸ¦œ
A hassle-free, highly performant and fast evolving Discord music bot built with Serenity in Rust.

## Deployment

### Docker

For the hassle free deployment, we suggest using the following:

```shell
docker build . -t parrot
docker run -d parrot
```

## Development

### Linux / MacOS
The command below installs a C compiler, GNU autotools, Opus (Discord's audio codec), youtube-dl and FFmpeg.


```shell
apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool m4 libopus-dev youtube-dl ffmpeg
```

### Windows
If you are using the MSVC toolchain, a prebuilt DLL for Opus is already provided for you.  
You will only need to download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and install youtube-dl which can be done through Python's package manager, pip.
```shell
pip install youtube_dl
```

## Usage
Just [create a bot account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html), copy its token into a `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable and `cargo run`.
