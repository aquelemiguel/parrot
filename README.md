## Development

Mostly due to [Songbird](https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird)'s dependencies, before starting development you will need to run the following.

### Linux / MacOS

```shell
apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool m4 youtube_dl ffmpeg
```

### Windows 

In Windows you will only need to download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and install `youtube_dl` through `pip`.
```shell
pip install youtube_dl
```
